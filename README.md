## Hi! I'm coffeebank ☕

Who am I? I'm a casual web developer, programmer, and Linux user who makes stuff because it's fun 🧑‍💻

### Being a "User" Sucks....

Have you ever wondered, *"if only that website's shade of gray was darker..."*? Or, you know that almost-perfect Discord bot for hugs and kisses, but always *requires* a @mention so you can never say `=hug server` to your friends? Yes, this is literally why I learned how to code.

Come join me on my journey of stumbling through this wonderful land of programming :) Not for any particular reason (I'm not a Computer Science major), but I sure as heck hope some of my code can help you better engage with the technology around you! [My Discord link's 🆙 above](#top)
