## Hi! I'm coffeebank â˜•

Who am I? Just a casual web developer, programmer, and Linux user who likes making stuff for fun :)

### Coding changes expectations....

- Sometimes, you just need something that isn't bloated, runs locally, and more customized for your needs
- Sometimes, a service is nice, but it's just missing *that one little thing* you know only takes a few minutes to code/fix
- Sometimes, it's wanting to type one last `.hug server` to your Discord friends, but the bot is requiring you to @mention

Come join me on my journey of stumbling through this wonderful land of code :) I'm no computer science major, but I hope some of my code can be useful to you! [Have questions?
