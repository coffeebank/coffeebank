## Hi! I'm coffeebank â˜•

Who am I? Just a casual web developer, programmer, and Linux user who likes making stuff because it's fun :)

### Being a "User" Sucks....

Do you ever wonder, *"if only that website's shade of gray was darker..."*? Or, you know that almost-perfect Discord bot for hugs and kisses, but always *requires* a @mention so you can never say `=hug server` to your friends? Yes, this is literally what pushed me to learn coding.

Come join me on my journey of stumbling through this wonderful land of code :) I'm no computer science major, but I hope some of my code can be useful to you! [Have questions? Reach me on Discord ðŸ“¬](https://coffeebank.github.io/discord)
